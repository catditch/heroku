Heroku DropWizard Example
=========================

This is a simple 'Hello World' Java DropWizard web application which is deployable to Heroku.

This example is based on the DropWizard and Heroku tutorial by https://github.com/ajordens here:

Here's how I deployed this to Heroku:

* Install Heroku.
* Clone this repository.
* Run: heroku login
* Run: heroku create
* Run: git push heroku master
* Visit the URL reported on the console.

Feel free to copy this project for whatever purpose. No warranty is offered.
